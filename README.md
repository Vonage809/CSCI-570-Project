# CSCI-570-Project: Sequence Alignment Problem
Basic + Memory Efficient Implementations
Using Python3

# TO-DO
**input string generator...create a string for the actual algorithm**
    - assume valid string and integer input (ACTG only and non negative/within bounds of string)
    - same for basic/efficient versions
    - use the same method in the respective files (basic_3.py and efficient_3.py)
    - j does NOT have to equal k!!!!
    - should read from an input file.
    - needs to output results into a separate file


**basic version**
    - hardcode gap penalty (delta) & mismatch costs (alpha)
    - ???

**memory efficient version**
    - divide and conquer
    - black magic???

**output file**
    - cost of alignment (int)
    - first string alignment (ACTG_)
    - second string alignment (ACTG_)
    - time in ms (float) 
        **refer to code pg 10 of specs
    - memory in kb (float)
        **refer to code pg 10 of specs

**report graph && summary.docx analysis**
    - run the 2 algorithms on the 15 input files in "datapoints" folder. Make 2 graphs:
        - 1 plot for CPU time vs problem size for both solutions
            **iirc, the CPU time should be the same for both solutions
            **X-axis = problem size, m+n (length of input strings). 
            **Y-axis = CPU time, ms.
        - 1 plot for Memory usage vs problem size for 2 solutions
            **X-axis = problem size, m+n (length of input strings). 
            **Y-axis = Memory Usage, KB.
    - fill out the summary.docx
    - don't have to provide the code for making the plots. Just images. 
    
**shell files**
    - ??? think this is just command console scripts 

**submission**
    - double check file structure/naming format
